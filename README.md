# **Object Detection App**  
![App Screenshot](./assets/app-screenshot.png)

This project is an interactive object detection application using OpenCV, YOLOv8, Tkinter, and Pillow. The app allows users to load images or video streams, detect objects, and visualize the results in real-time.

## **Features**
- **Real-Time Object Detection**: Utilizes YOLOv8 for high-accuracy object detection.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Tkinter for an easy-to-use graphical interface.
- **Image Handling**: Powered by Pillow for image loading and processing.
- **Supports Images & Videos**: Detect objects in both images and live video streams.
