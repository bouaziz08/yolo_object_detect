# **Object Detection App**  

This project is an interactive object detection application using OpenCV, YOLOv8, Tkinter, and Pillow. The app allows users to load images, detect objects, and visualize the results in real-time.

## **Features**
- **Real-Time Object Detection**: Utilizes YOLOv8 for high-accuracy object detection.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Tkinter for an easy-to-use graphical interface.
- **Image Handling**: Powered by Pillow for image loading and processing.
- **Supports Images & Videos**: Detect objects in both images and live video streams.

## **Technologies Used**
- **OpenCV**: For image and video processing.
- **YOLOv8**: Latest YOLO model for object detection.
- **Tkinter**: Python's built-in library for GUI development.
- **Pillow**: Image handling and manipulation in Python.

## **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bouaziz08/yolo_object_detect.git
    ```
2. Install required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Download the YOLOv8 model weights and place them in the `runs/detect` directory.
